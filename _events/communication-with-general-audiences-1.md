* Read: [Pixar's 22 Rules of Storytelling](https://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/07/pixars-22-rules-of-storytelling/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. What can Pixar teach you about communicating your research?
* Prepare a 5-min presentation (with slides) about your current research project, or a project you’ve worked on before, or a research paper you enjoy. Assume a general audience that has some (but not a lot of) familiarity with CS (e.g. first-year college students interested in CS).
